I took 7 3-minute 4k videos of different sections of the moon (2 for the bottom half, 2 for the top half, and 3 for the middle section [the entire moon did not fit in one frame]). I had to recheck focus for each section and I think my focus was off for the lower left section of the Moon. I then used PIPP to splice each video into individual frames (about 5000 frames (.tifs) per video [some were less due to tech errors]). I then used AutoStakkert! to stack the top 25%-50% of frames. I then brought each section into Photoshop through an auto-collage merge and made final adjustments (levels, curves, vibrancy/saturation). I also added in the glow (by adding a circle with an &quotouter glow&quot) as well as background stars (from an image I took back in February of Corvus).">
