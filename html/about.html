                <p>Thank you for coming to my site.  I made this digital portfolio to showcase some of my favorite photos I have taken since starting my passion for photography. This passion started when I took River Rossi's Digital Landscape class at Carleton College and got the chance to experiment with many types of photography.  I took an extreme liking to long-exposure photography, shown through my atrophotographs. </p>
                <p>I got the name Clex Digital from my friends at Carleton who switched the A and C from my names to make 'Clex Aardenas'. It stuck. I have many, many people to thank for this site, including my parents, my girlfriend Paj Yao Vwj, Jonathon Liou who inspiried me to make a website, and River Rossi.</p>
